ACGAN: Implemented Auxiliary classifier GANs (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09585) on CIFAR-10.

GAN_celebfaces: Trained GANs on 128x128 images from celebfaces attributes dataset. Experimented with interpolating between generated outputs by training an autoencoder to transform an image to its latent noise and the noise can then be decoded with GAN to get a reconstruction of the original image.
